This is a link to the source code of the tools, PAREfirst and PAREnet, that I implemeted and presented in my PhD thesis.

Since the tools are integrated within the UEA sRNA Workbench, there are some missing dependencies in the code.

To run the tools, please download the latest version of the sRNA Workbench:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/srnaworkbench/files

Tutorial data for each tool are provided in the tutorial data directory.

For any questions, contact: Salma.Alzahranii@gmail.com
