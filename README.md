This is a link to the source code of the tool, PAREnet, that I implemeted and presented in my PhD thesis.

Since the tool is integrated within the UEA sRNA Workbench, there are some missing dependencies in the code.

To run PAREnet, please download the latest version of the sRNA Workbench:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/srnaworkbench/files

Tutorial data for the tool are provided in the PAREnet tutorial data directory.

For any questions, contact: Salma.Alzahranii@gmail.com
